### About
Throughout the previous semester, I developed a software application designed to process a noisy signal containing residual echo by implementing an echo cancellation algorithm. This algorithm relies on the concept that the audio of the initial speaker reaches the second person's ears before reflecting back. By estimating the second speaker's input, we are able to effectively minimize the echoes present in the speech.
